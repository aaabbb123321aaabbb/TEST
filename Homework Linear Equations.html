<h3>Homework "Linear Equations"</h3>

<b>Objective</b>

<p>Implement functions to i) solve linear equations; ii) calculate
matrix inverse; and iii) calculate matrix determinant. The method to
use is the modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.

<p>The Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process, even modified, is less
stable and accurate than the Givens roation algorithm.  On the other
hand, the Gram-Schmidt process produces the j-th orthogonalized vector
after the j-th iteration, while orthogonalization using Givens rotations
produces all vectors only at the end of the process. This makes the
Gram–Schmidt process applicable for iterative methods like the
Arnoldir/Lanczos iteration.

Also its ease of implementation makes it a useful exercise for the
students.

<b>Hints</b>

	<ul>
<li>To work with matrices and vectors you may
use the matrix and vector classes from
<a href="../csharp/matlib/matrix"><code>../csharp/matlib/matrix</code></a>
[<a href="../c++/matrix"><code>../c++/matrix</code></a>].
They
implement some basic matrix/vector operations. Alternatively,
you can implement your own matrix/vector classes the way you like
it (a good way to learn a language). At the bare minimum your classes
might look something like (read <a
href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/indexers">the
manual</a> about indexers in Csharp),

	<pre>
public class vector{
   public double[] data;
   public int size =&gt; data.Length;
   public double this[int i]{   // indexer
      get =&gt; data[i];        // getter
      set =&gt; data[i]=value;  // setter
      }
   public vector(int n){        // constructor
      data=new double[n];
      }
}
	</pre>

<pre>
public class matrix{
	public readonly int size1,size2;
	private double[] data;  // to keep matrix elements
	public matrix(int n,int m){      // constructor
		size1=n; size2=m;
		data = new double[size1*size2];
		}
	public double this[int i,int j]{     // indexer
		get =&gt; data[i+j*size1];
		set =&gt; data[i+j*size1]=value;
		}
}
</pre>

<li>You can generate (pseudo-)random numbers, uniformly distributed from
zero to one, like this,
	<pre>
var rnd = new System.Random(1); /* or any other seed */
double x = rnd.NextDouble();
double y = rnd.NextDouble();
double z = rnd.NextDouble();
	</pre>

<li>QR-factorization of a matrix consists of two matrices, Q and R.
There are several options for the interface to your routines:

	<ol>

<li><p>Return Q and R in a tuple (like scipy),

	<pre>
public static class QR{
   public static (matrix,matrix) decomp(matrix A){
      matrix Q=A.copy();
      matrix R=new matrix(A.size2,A.size2);
      /* orthogonalize Q and fill-in R */
      return (Q,R);
      }
   public static vector solve(matrix Q, matrix R, vector b){ ... }
   public static double det(matrix R){ ... }
   public static matrix inverse(matrix Q,matrix R){ ... }
}
	</pre>

<li>Keep Q and R and an instance of the non-static class QR,

	<pre>
public class QR{
   matrix Q,R;
   public QR(matrix A){ /* the above "decomp" is the constructor here */
      Q=A.copy();
      R=new matrix(A.size2,A.size2);
      /* orthogonalize Q and fill-in R */
      }
   public vector solve(vector b){ ... }
   public double det(){ ... }
   public matrix inverse(){ ... }
} </pre>

<li>You can add matrices Q and R
and the methods
<code>decomp</code>,
<code>solve</code>,
<code>inverse</code>,
<code>det</code>
directly to your matrix class (declare it <code>partial</code> then
you can add things to it using a file in your homework directory).

	</ol>

	</ul>

<b>Tasks</b>

<ol type=A>

<li><p>(6 points) <b>Solving linear equations using QR-decomposition
by modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization</b>

<p>Implement a static (or, at your choice, non-static) class "QR"
with functions "decomp", "solve", and "det" (as indicated above). In
the non-static class "decomp" becomes a constructor and must be called
"QR").

<p>The function "decomp" (or the constructor QR) should perform
stabilized Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of an n&times;m (where n&ge;m)
matrix A and calculate R.

<p>
The function/method "solve" should use the matrices Q and R from
"decomp" and solve the
equation <i>QRx=b</i> for the given right-hand-side "b".

<p>The function/method "det" should return the determinant of matrix R which
is equal to the determinant of the original matrix.  Determinant of a
triangular matrix is given by the product of its diagonal elements.

<p>
Check that your "decomp" works as intended:
<ul>
<li>generate a random tall (n&gt;m) matrix A (of a modest size);
<li>factorize it into QR;
<li>check that R is upper triangular;
<li>check that Q<sup>T</sup>Q=1;
<li>check that QR=A;
</ul>

<p>
Check that you "solve" works as intended:
<ul>
<li>generate a random square matrix A (of a modest size);
<li>generate a random vector b (of the same size);
<li>factorize A into QR;
<li>solve QRx=b;
<li>check that Ax=b;
</ul>

<li><p> (3 points) <b>Matrix inverse by Gram-Schmidt QR factorization</b>


<p>Add the function/method "inverse" to your "QR" class that, using
the calculated Q and R, should calculate the inverse of the matrix A
and returns it.

<p>
Check that you function works as intended:
<ul>
<li>generate a random square matrix A (of a modest size);
<li>factorize A into QR;
<li>calculate the inverse B;
<li>check that AB=I, where I is the identity matrix;
</ul>

<li><p> (1 point) <b>Operations count for QR-decomposition</b>

<p>Measure the time it takes to QR-factorize (with your implementation)
a random NxN matrix as function of N. Convince yourself that it goes like
O(N³): measure (using the POSIX <code>time</code> utility) the time
it takes to QR-factorize an N&times;N matrix for several values of N,
plot the time as function of N in gnuplot and fit with N³.

<p>You can build your timing data like this (you might want to read
<pre>man bash | less +/"for name"
man 1 seq
man 1 time </pre>
),
	<pre>
out.times.data : main.exe
	&gt;$@
	for N in $$(seq 100 20 200); do \
		time --format "$$N %e" --output $@ --append \
		mono $&lt; -size:$$N 1&gt;out 2&gt;err ;\
	done </pre>
